contact-app
===========

The contact-app is a demo application that displays a list of contacts and their details based on the Solstice contact API.

##Requirements to build the application

Please follow [This guide](https://academy.appgyver.com/installwizard) to setup Steroids, NodeJS and your developer tools

######Building the Project

1. Download the project.

2. In terminal, cd into the directory `cd contact-app`

3. Build the project by typing `steroids connect`

4. Once the project is built type the letter 's' in terminal to start the simulator. You can also scan the QR code with your mobile
device if the Appgyver Scanner app is installed on your phone and you are on the same network as your computer.
The Appgyver Scanner app is available in both the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgyver.android&hl=en)
and [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appgyver-scanner/id575076515?mt=8) markets.

5. If you would like to run the application from a different network than your computer or over a cellular network you
can run `steroids deploy` instead of `steroids connect`. Or you simply open this [URL](https://share.appgyver.com/?id=23715&hash=20df2653aa0278eea1ba3657b7ba194e12c597e5494caa77963d5979535f8db9)
On the deploy page, you can not only scan the QR code with any device but you can also demo the application using the on-page simulator (it's a little slow).


######Running the Application Without Building

1. Open this [URL](https://share.appgyver.com/?id=23715&hash=20df2653aa0278eea1ba3657b7ba194e12c597e5494caa77963d5979535f8db9)

2. On the deploy page, you can either scan the QR code with any device that has the scanner app installed or you can demo the application using the on-page simulator (it's a little slow).
